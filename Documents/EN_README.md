### Features of this card.
<details>
<summary>This card has eight LEDs, one buzzer, three push buttons, and one USB UART interface.<br><br></summary>

>- Its size is the same as that of a Raspberry Pi Zero module. It integrates perfectly with the Pi Zero SBC type series<br>
(SBC :single-board computer)<br>
>- It is also compatible with Raspberry Pi sizes: <br>
>   - Standard size : 3B/3B+/4B1GB/4B2GB/4B4GB<br>
>   - Medium size: 3A+<br>
>   - Small size: Pi Zero/W/WH..<br>
>- Its pinout is fully compatible with the GPIO Bus of Raspberry modules.
>- The 8 LEDs are selectable via the pins  GPIO (17, 18, 27, 22, 25, 12, 13, 19) in BCM mode.<br>
>- The three push buttons are programmable via the pins GPIO (21,19,20) in BCM mode. <br>
>- The Buzzer can be activated on the pin (GPIO 26)  in BCM mode.<br>
>- The GPIO pins assigned to each functionality are clearly identified (screen printed) on the printed circuit.<br>Including SPI, UART, I2C, 5V, 3.3V, et GND.<br>
>- Its USB input acts as a power input and UART ports..
>- Its USB input voltage is 5v. The source can be a PC, a power bank or an AC adapter.<br>
    It can also be powered by the 5V BUS of the Raspberry Pi module.

>>>-  **AIM**<br>

>>>       - int in  [2, 3, .. oo[.<br> 
>>>       - Expressed in seconds <br>
>>>      -  Default value 2.<br><br>
